# Learning lab companion

This bot comes as a companion to the [DevNet learning lab: "Creating Conversational Bots with BoKit"](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/tracks/collab-cloud/spark-apps/collab-spark-botkit/step/1).

The concept of conversations is illustrated with increasingly complex conversations where a user is asked to pick a color:

- [color](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/botkit-ciscospark-samples/blob/master/learninglab/skills/color.js) : asks a user to pick a color (no check)
- [restricted](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/botkit-ciscospark-samples/blob/master/learninglab/skills/restricted.js) : let a user pick a color among a set of options
- [threads](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/botkit-ciscospark-samples/blob/master/learninglab/skills/threads.js) : branch to another thread
- [variables](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/botkit-ciscospark-samples/blob/master/learninglab/skills/variables.js) : enriched user-context among threads
